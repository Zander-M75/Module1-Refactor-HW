# Module1-Refactor-HW


## Description

The intent of this activity was to train a variety of skills in HTML, CSS, and GitHub.
The activity involved refactoring the existing code for Horiseon's SEO website.  In order to complete this I had to refigure the navigation bar and shrink down the HTML and CSS code to adhere with agile standards as best as possible.
